Living and working on a boat means your home, office, and playground are all the same place. That freedom is part of the dream—but it also makes boundaries tricky. When every sunrise is a potential travel day and every sunset might be a dinghy ride to shore, it’s easy to blur the lines between work and life. Here’s how we set expectations, maintain balance, and make it work (without losing our minds).

### 1. Morning Check-Ins Keep Everyone on the Same Page

Every day, my family does a quick morning huddle. We run through the day’s work and cruising plans—who has calls, what meetings require quiet, and whether we’ll be underway or anchored. If a big meeting overlaps with a lock-through or dock arrival, we reschedule one or the other. It’s a simple habit that saves a lot of chaos.

### 2. Be Honest About Your Bandwidth—Mentally and Digitally

Even if the internet is strong enough for Zoom, your brain might not be. We’ve learned to protect deep focus by anchoring (literally) in calm spots and scheduling creative work for times when we’re not navigating or troubleshooting systems. It’s okay to admit that you can’t do everything at once.

### 3. Take the Kids Off the Boat (When You Can)

If one of us has an important meeting or call, we might take the kids off the boat for a bit—maybe to a playground or even a walk to get snacks. It’s not just about quiet—it also helps reset the rhythm of the day and gives everyone some space.

### 4. Let Go of the 9-to-5

Cruising life is already unconventional. Your workday might start at 6 a.m. so you can be done before the afternoon storms roll in—or maybe you log hours after sunset while the kids read below deck. Don’t try to force traditional hours onto a very non-traditional lifestyle.

### 5. Build in Time Off—Seriously

When you live where you work, it’s easy to slip into always-on mode. We intentionally plan “zero work” days, even if we’re still moving the boat or doing school with the kids. Just like any job, downtime helps avoid burnout—and lets you actually enjoy the lifestyle you’ve worked so hard to create.
