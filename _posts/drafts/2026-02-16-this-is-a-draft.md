_Ideas for people who have contract-based work in their professions._

### **Blog Post Title Ideas:**

**From Reddit:**  
I'm doing nursing in the US. Can sign a 3 month contract in a coastal city then just not sign a contract for however long I want and cruise around. Usually marinas are pretty receptive when I ask for 3 months full time but pay for all 3 months up front. Getting a car to wherever is a pita, used delivery services and just biked in the past. Work 3 12 hour shifts/ week and sail and fish the other 4. Pretty sweet life. Winter is for boat work
