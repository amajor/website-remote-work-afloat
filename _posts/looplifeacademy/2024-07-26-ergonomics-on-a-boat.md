Ergonomics is the science of designing and arranging things people use so that people and things interact most efficiently and safely. It focuses on optimizing the work environment to fit the worker’s needs, aiming to improve comfort, efficiency, and productivity while reducing the risk of injury or discomfort.

**What is “ergonomics?”**

It is the study of people’s efficiency in their working environment.

In our case, let’s look at ergonomics on BOATS!

Boats are not optimized office spaces. However, considering ergonomics and making a few adjustments can greatly enhance comfort, productivity, and overall well-being, reducing the risk of injury and stress while promoting a healthier work-life balance.

### The Importance of Ergonomics for Remote Workers on Boats

Proper ergonomics is essential for remote workers, especially those working from a boat’s unique and often challenging environment. Good ergonomic practices help reduce physical strain, prevent injury, and enhance productivity, making maintaining a healthy and efficient work routine easier.

Remote workers on boats face specific ergonomic challenges, such as limited space and unconventional seating arrangements. The confined quarters of a boat often make traditional office setups unfeasible, leading to makeshift workstations that may not support proper posture.

### Creative Solutions for Working in Small Spaces

Working in small spaces, like a boat, presents unique challenges that require creative solutions to maintain productivity and comfort.

One practical approach is to utilize multi-functional furniture. For example, a dining table can double as a work desk during the day. Portable, foldable desks and chairs can be easily stored when not in use, freeing up valuable living space.

Another idea is to use wall-mounted shelves and organizers to keep work essentials off the limited desk space, creating a clutter-free environment that enhances focus and efficiency.

#### Chair and Seating Arrangements

Provide yourself with proper lumbar support wherever you choose to sit on the boat. A cushion can make a significant difference; depending on your layout, you can also use a back cushion. Your boat might have some adjustable or multi-functional seating options. Get creative!

#### Desk and Work Surface

Most adults’ ideal desk height is between 28 and 30 inches (71 and 76 cm). Consider using desk risers or a height-adjustable chair to achieve the proper positioning.

When seated, your elbows should be at a 90-degree angle or slightly more open, and your forearms should be parallel to the floor when your hands are on the keyboard or mouse.

Your feet should be flat on the floor or a footrest, your knees at a 90-degree angle, and your thighs parallel to the floor. This positioning helps maintain proper circulation and reduces lower back strain.

#### Monitor and Screen Positioning

The top of your monitor should be at or just below eye level. This ensures you look slightly downward at the screen, reducing neck strain. Use a monitor stand or stack of books to achieve the correct height if needed.

Your monitor should be about an arm’s length away from your eyes, which helps prevent eye strain and encourages a more relaxed viewing posture.

#### Keyboard and Mouse Placement

Place your keyboard and mouse at a height that allows your wrists to remain straight and your hands to move freely. Keep them close enough to avoid overreaching, which can cause shoulder and arm strain.

I use a “split keyboard” so that I can keep my shoulders broad while I work. I prefer using a trackpad, but my husband likes to use a vertical mouse while working.

Most ancillary tools are paired via Bluetooth, but if you find yourself with many cords, consider some velcro cord ties to keep your area neat.

#### Lighting

Proper lighting reduces eye strain and improves focus.

My boat offers many options for natural light, but I also have a bendy light that I can shine on my desk if needed.

### The Importance of Regular Breaks and Movement

Regular breaks and incorporating movement into your day are essential for maintaining physical and mental health, especially when working in confined spaces. Prolonged periods of sitting can lead to muscle stiffness, decreased circulation, and increased stress levels.

Setting a timer to remind yourself to take a break every 30 to 60 minutes can help mitigate these issues. Stand up, stretch, and move around during these breaks to promote blood flow and alleviate tension.

We’ve put together a few simple exercise ideas in a blog post for you:

### Converting Living Spaces into Ergonomic Workspaces and Back

Transitioning living spaces into ergonomic workspaces and back is crucial for maintaining a healthy work-life balance on a boat. Start by designating specific areas for work and relaxation. For example, use a collapsible desk in the galley or saloon for work hours and store it away when it’s time to unwind. This clear separation helps create a mental distinction between work and leisure, crucial for maintaining a balanced lifestyle.

Use portable accessories, like a laptop stand and external keyboard, to create a comfortable setup that can be easily packed away. Once your workday ends, take a few minutes to clear your workspace and transition the area back into a living space.

This process keeps your boat organized, and signals to your brain that switching from work to relaxation mode is time. By incorporating these strategies, you can effectively balance professional and personal life, even in the limited space of a boat.
