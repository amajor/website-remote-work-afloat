Happy New Year, fellow adventurers! 🎉

I’m thrilled to share that I was recently featured on _The Boater’s Lounge_ podcast to kick off 2025, diving into one of my favorite topics: the Great Loop. In this episode, we talk all about my family’s journey—how we got started, the highs and lows, and why I launched Loop Life Academy to help other families considering this life-changing adventure.

This episode covers so much ground (or should I say water?)., from the peaceful waters of the Erie Canal to some of the challenges we faced, like navigating the Gulf of Mexico and managing seasickness along the way. It’s a real behind-the-scenes look at life on the Loop—the unforgettable moments, the lessons learned, and how it’s shaped our family.

I also share practical tips for aspiring Loopers and explain how my passion for this lifestyle inspired me to create resources, guides, and courses to help other families make the leap. Whether you’re dreaming about the Great Loop, actively planning your journey, or just love hearing stories about boating adventures, this episode has something for everyone.

If you’re curious about:

- What it’s like to live on a boat with kids.
    
- The unexpected challenges (and how we tackled them).
    
- Why I believe the Great Loop is the ultimate adventure for families.
    

… then you’ll definitely want to tune in!
