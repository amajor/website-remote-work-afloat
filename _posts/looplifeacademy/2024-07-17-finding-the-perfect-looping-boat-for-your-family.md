When it comes to selecting the perfect boat for your family, it’s essential to remember that there is no “one size fits all” solution. Each boat is unique, just like each family. The key is to find a boat that best suits your family’s needs and cruising plans. Here’s a guide to help you navigate this process, complete with recommended boats and helpful resources.

## Recommended Boats for Looping

Below is not an extensive list, but hopefully will get you started with some ideas of what to look for and what might work for you and your family. It’s a very subjective decision, and there is no definitive list to give you the correct answer.

Use these lists simply as guides to help you get started.

_Be aware of the impact the age of the boat may have on your ability to get insurance coverage. We’ve seen an increasing number of people have difficulty getting insurance for boats over 30 years old._

### Sailing Vessels

Here are some great options for families interested in sailing vessels. My family has traveled the Loop in a sailboat. While this may not be the right choice if you are new to boating, it can be great if you already know and love sailing.

Remember that having a **deck-stepped** **mast** will make your mast-stepping process a little easier when you travel through canals and rivers that require your mast down. If you plan to do open-water sailing in addition to your Loop Adventure, consider a **keel-stepped mast** (less convenient when you’ll need to remove your mast).

Also, many fixed bridges in the ICW and other narrow areas have a clearance of 65 feet, so you’ll have more options if you can **keep your air draft around 62 feet or less** to have some wiggle room.

These motor vessels and sailboats are ideal because they offer two or three staterooms, a helpful addition for families. The vessels provide ample living space, comfort, and stability, crucial for extended cruising. They are also within the typical size range for a Looper boat (40-50 feet).

## Key Considerations

#### Water Draft

For traveling the Great Loop, it’s recommended to have a draft of less than 5 feet. While some boats with deeper drafts can manage in certain areas, a draft of 5 feet or less provides greater flexibility.

Our sailboat has a 4.9’ draft, which has served us well throughout our journey.

#### Air Draft

If you’re on a sailboat, you’ll need to take your mast down for parts of the Loop. Our experience with this process is detailed in Practical Sailor, which can give you some insight into what it involves: [Un-Stepping the Mast for America’s Great Loop - Practical Sailor](https://www.practical-sailor.com/sails-rigging-deckgear/standing-rigging/un-stepping-the-mast-for-americas-great-loop-2).

Keep in mind that having a **deck-stepped** mast does make this process a little easier, and finding a mast that’s under 65’ air draft will make it easier for you with route options within the ICW if you want or need to stay inland _(many fixed bridges are set at 65’ clearance)_.

Motor vessels still have a few places where you need to be aware of height restrictions due to fixed bridges.

When you approach the Erie Canal, you’ll have three route options depending on what you can clear. If you can clear 15 feet, you can travel the entire Erie Canal. If you can clear 17 feet, you could make the “triangle loop” into Lake Champlain and the St. Lawrence Seaway to Lake Ontario. If you can clear 21 feet, you can take the Erie Canal to the Oswego Canal to Lake Ontario.

There is also a fixed bridge just south of Chicago that is limited to 19 feet, 6 inches, and all boats must be able to clear.

#### Additional Considerations

- **Displacement**: Heavier displacement boats provide a stable and comfortable ride.
    
- **Cabin Layout**: Look for a boat with a two-cabin or three-cabin layout to ensure everyone has their own space. A comfortable cockpit is also essential.
    
- **Storage and Amenities**: Ample storage and essential amenities, such as a good-sized galley, comfortable berths, and adequate headroom, are crucial for long-term living.
    
- **Condition and Maintenance**: Ensure the boat is in good condition or factor in potential refurbishments. A well-maintained boat will minimize unexpected repairs and ensure a smoother journey.
    
- **Comfort and Safety**: Consider features that enhance comfort and safety, such as a reliable autopilot, a well-protected cockpit, and robust anchoring equipment.
    
- **Performance and Handling**: Conduct trial sails to understand how different boats handle and to assess their comfort levels.
    

## Community Resources

Joining supportive communities can provide valuable insights and help you find the perfect boat. One highly recommended group is **Kids4Sail**, which is active on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/share/9PuqKdXyBYnMhqhL/) and [NoForeignLand](https://www.noforeignland.com/partners/kids4sail/). This group is a fantastic resource for cruising families and features a monthly thread for families selling their boats.

Once you have your vessel, consider downloading the [**NoForeignLand App**](https://www.noforeignland.com/app) and joining the **Kids4Sail** group there. This app makes it easy to filter the map to family boats, allowing you to connect with other kid boats as you travel around.

Joining the [**AGLCA**](https://greatloop.org/) gives you access to many resources, from boat choosing to route planning. There is also a special interest group for families and growing resources for all types of adventurers (retirees, families, solo sailors, and more).

## Next Steps

#### 1: Boat Shows & Dealerships

Visit boat shows and dealerships to explore different models and their layouts.

Also consider attending an AGLCA Rendezvous, where a “Looper Crawl” is being hosted. This will give you an opportunity to visit different boats that people are using on the Loop, ask questions, and get an idea of what might work for your adventure.

#### 2: Trial Sails

Arrange trial sails to experience how different boats handle and to gauge their comfort levels.

#### 3: Consult a Broker

Work with a knowledgeable boat broker who understands your needs and can help you find the perfect boat.

If you aren’t sure where to start, the AGLCA recommends a number of brokers. Some of them work specifically with Loopers (and have traveled the Loop themselves).

_TIP: As a non-sponsored comment, I’ll mention that_ [_Great Loop Yacht Sales_](https://www.greatloopyachtsales.com/about-us/) _is one of those brokers recommended by the AGLCA. Brent Bowlin, one of the founders and brokers at Great Loop Yacht Sales (and a friend of our family), would be a great contact for families looking for a Loop boat since he and his family completed the Loop in 2021. Brent has first-hand experience in what this adventure looks like for families._

#### 4: Survey

Before purchasing, hire a professional surveyor to inspect any boat you’re considering thoroughly.

---

Choosing the right boat for your family is a significant step in your cruising adventure. With careful consideration and the right resources, you’ll find a vessel that provides comfort, safety, and endless opportunities for exploration and family bonding.

Happy sailing!
