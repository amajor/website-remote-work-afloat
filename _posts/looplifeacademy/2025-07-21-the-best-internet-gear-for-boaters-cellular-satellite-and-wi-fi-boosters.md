Staying connected on the water is a game changer, especially when you’re working remotely from a boat. Over the years, I’ve learned that no single internet solution fits every situation perfectly, so having a mix of options—and knowing how to use them efficiently—is key to keeping your workday smooth and your stress low.

### Starlink: The Satellite Solution with Some Power Needs

We rely on [Starlink (Roam)](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) as our primary internet connection while cruising. The speed and reliability have been a huge upgrade from cellular data alone, especially when we’re anchored or docked in more remote spots. But there’s a trade-off: [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) demands a lot of power, and since our battery bank isn’t enormous, we have to be strategic about when we turn it on.

Usually, we power it up only when we need high-bandwidth tasks like video calls or uploading large files. For everything else—email, document editing, or prepping offline work—we conserve energy by working in airplane mode or offline as much as possible. This balance has helped us avoid draining our batteries too quickly.

### Cellular Data: The Reliable Backup

Our cellular data plans serve as our safety net when [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) is off or unavailable. Depending on your cruising area, cellular can be surprisingly effective, especially near towns or marinas. We keep an eye on coverage maps and sometimes switch between providers or SIM cards to get the best signal. Using cellular data on a good booster can stretch your connection miles beyond what your phone alone can catch.

### Wi-Fi Boosters and Public Hotspots

If we’re spending a few days in one place, like a marina or town, we often take advantage of public Wi-Fi at libraries, coffee shops, or even local businesses. This lets us use “unlimited power” and fast internet without stressing the boat’s energy system.

A Wi-Fi booster can be a lifesaver in these situations, pulling in weak signals from shore to give you a stable connection onboard. Just remember to keep security in mind—using a VPN is a good habit when working over public networks.

### Tools and Tips to Manage Your Internet Efficiently

- **Power Planning:** Because satellite gear can draw a lot of power, know your battery limits and plan your work sessions around energy availability.
    
- **Offline Prep:** Download files and emails before leaving strong signal areas, and schedule work that doesn’t require connectivity during lower power times.
    
- **Multiple Devices:** Using a combination of [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57), cellular boosters, and public Wi-Fi helps cover more bases.
