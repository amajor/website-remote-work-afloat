When we started cruising full-time, the questions rolled in.

**“How do you get internet?”**

**“What do you do for work?”**

**“Is it even possible to hold a job from a boat?”**

The short answer? Yes—remote work afloat is absolutely possible. But there are a lot of misconceptions floating around out there (pun totally intended). Whether you’re dreaming of taking your career on the water or wondering how other people make it work, here are a few myths worth busting.

### Myth #1: You need perfect Wi-Fi to work from a boat.

Let’s get this one out of the way: if you’re expecting fiber-fast, always-on internet in every anchorage, you’ll be disappointed.

But do you need _perfect_ internet? Nope.

You need **reliable-enough** internet, and a plan for when it goes sideways. Most cruising workers use a combination of [**Starlink**](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57), **cellular data**, and **Wi-Fi boosters**, plus tools for **offline work** and **automated backups**. You learn to plan video calls around your anchorage, and yes, sometimes you move for better service. It’s just another layer of logistics.

### Myth #2: You have to be in tech.

The remote work world is a lot broader than people realize. Sure, there are plenty of software engineers, web developers, and UX designers cruising full-time—but they’re far from the only ones.

You’ll also find boaters working as:

- **Virtual assistants**
    
- **Online teachers and tutors**
    
- **Writers and editors**
    
- **Marketing strategists**
    
- **Customer support reps**
    
- **Bookkeepers**
    
- **Consultants**

- **Coaches and course creators**
    

If you can do it with a laptop and an internet connection, someone out there is doing it from a boat.

### Myth #3: You need to work full-time.

Not true.

Some people cruise while running full-time businesses. Others freelance a few hours a week to cover expenses. Some work in seasons, hustling during hurricane season and taking breaks in the Bahamas.

Boat life has a way of pushing you toward flexibility. That can be scary if you’re used to a traditional job, but it also opens the door to **creative income streams** that fit the lifestyle you want.

### Myth #4: It’s too stressful to manage work and cruising.

It _can_ be stressful, especially if you’re juggling weather, boat projects, and Zoom meetings on a tight deadline. But with some **good habits** and **expectation-setting**, it’s totally doable.

A few things that help:

- Planning anchorage locations around internet needs
    
- Communicating availability with clients or teams
    
- Setting boundaries (even if the view out your “office” is distracting)
    
- Building in buffer time for boat repairs or weather delays
    

There’s no shame in saying “I’ll be offline this afternoon to go through a lock.” That’s the beauty of this lifestyle.

### Myth #5: You can’t work and enjoy the cruising life.

You absolutely can, but it requires balance.

You probably won’t be sightseeing every day. You may need to skip a beach trip to finish a project. But we’ve found that working afloat gives us the freedom to stay longer, travel slower, and live in a way that aligns with our values.

It’s not about making every moment picture-perfect. It’s about creating a life that blends **meaningful work** and **meaningful adventure.**
