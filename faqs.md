## 💬 GENERAL QUESTIONS

### Who is this book for?

Remote Work Afloat is for anyone considering working remotely while living aboard a boat—whether you’re planning the Great Loop, coastal cruising, full-time sailing, or extended liveaboard travel. It’s ideal for digital nomads, homeschooling families, tech professionals, freelancers, and anyone navigating both boat life and remote work.

### Do I need to be a full-time cruiser for this book to be useful?

Not at all. While the book is written from the perspective of a full-time cruiser, the tools, strategies, and workspace setups are also helpful for weekenders, part-timers, RVers, and anyone managing limited space and inconsistent connectivity.

### I’m brand new to boats. Will this book still help me?

Yes! This book includes plain-language explanations and a glossary to help you get comfortable with the basics. You don’t need to be a seasoned mariner to benefit from the tips, checklists, and real-life advice.

## ⚙️ TECH & CONNECTIVITY

### What kind of internet setup do I need to work from a boat?

That depends on where you cruise, what kind of work you do, and your budget. Remote Work Afloat breaks down the main options (Starlink, mobile hotspots, Wi-Fi boosters, routers, and more) so you can build a setup that fits your needs, whether you’re at a dock or anchored off-grid.

### Does this book cover Starlink?

Yes. The book includes an entire section on Starlink for cruisers—what you need to know before buying, tips for installing on a boat, and how it compares to other options.

### I’m not tech-savvy. Will I be able to follow the guidance?

Absolutely. The tech sections are written in a friendly, accessible tone. You’ll find step-by-step checklists and real-world examples (not jargon) to help you confidently set up your connection.
