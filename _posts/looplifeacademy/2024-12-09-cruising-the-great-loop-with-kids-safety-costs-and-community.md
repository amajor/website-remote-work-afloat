_“Then there is the most dangerous risk of all: the risk of spending your life not doing what you want, on the bet you can buy yourself the freedom to do it later.”_

This quote from Randy Komisar resonates deeply with me. It’s a reminder that neither retirement nor good health in retirement is guaranteed. Sometimes, you have to take a leap of faith and pursue the adventure or experience you dream about—now, not later.

This mindset is what led my husband, Chris, and me to move our family onto a boat and embark on America’s Great Loop with our kids. It wasn’t an easy decision, but it was the right one for us.

## Is It Safe?

One of the first questions people ask when they hear about our lifestyle is: _“Is it safe to move your kids onto a boat?”_

This question reminds me of a [comic by Sarah Steenland](https://www.sarahsteenland.com/post/why-you-choose-to-sail-the-world-comic). It shows a boater and a friend on the dock. The friend says, _“I heard you’re planning to sail around the world with your family. Isn’t that dangerous?”_ The boater replies, _“Either one of us might die tomorrow. I may be swept from the deck of my boat and drown. You could be hit by a bus on your way to work. If I succeed, I’ll get to snorkel, hike, and live in paradise. If you succeed, you’ll get to work.”_

That comic encapsulates why we chose this lifestyle. Yes, there are risks. But with proper planning, education, and preparation, those risks become manageable.

#### Why the Great Loop Is “Low Risk, High Adventure”

The Great Loop is a relatively safe route for boaters. You’re usually close to land, and there’s a strong community of Loopers to offer guidance and support. Even the most daunting stretch—the Gulf of Mexico crossing—can be planned around weather windows or bypassed altogether by staying closer to shore.

Here are some key steps we’ve taken to make boating safer:

- **Boating Education:** Taking classes to understand navigation, emergency procedures, and radio use is essential.
    
- **Safety Gear:** We keep life jackets, EPIRBs, flares, and other Coast Guard-required equipment on board and know how to use them.
    
- **Weather Planning:** The golden rule is: _Never sail to a schedule._ By prioritizing weather windows, we ensure every trip is as safe and comfortable as possible.
    

## How Much Does It Cost?

Another big question we get is: _“How much does this lifestyle cost, and how do you afford it?”_

The cost of doing the Loop varies widely depending on your choices. Here are the main expenses to consider:

- **The Boat:** Your initial investment will depend on the size and type of boat you choose. Maintenance is another factor—budget about 10% of your boat’s value annually for repairs and upkeep.
    
- **Fuel:** Fuel costs depend on your boat’s consumption. For example, our sailboat uses about 1 gallon per hour, but faster motorboats may consume much more.
    
- **Dockage:** Marina fees are typically charged per foot of your boat’s length. Rates range from $1 to $8 per foot, with an average of $3–$4. However, anchoring is free, and we prefer it for comfort and cost savings.
    
- **Food:** Whether you cook on board or eat out, your food costs will be similar to life on land but can vary by region.
    

As for how we pay for it, Chris and I both work full-time remotely. I run my own business now, which offers the flexibility to balance work with travel. Other Loopers fund their journeys through savings, sabbaticals, or even using accumulated vacation time to travel in segments.

## Finding Community on the Water

As a family, one of the biggest challenges was finding other kids for our children to connect with. While there aren’t always many families on the Loop simultaneously, we found community in unexpected places:

- **Playgrounds and Libraries:** These became hubs for meeting local kids wherever we docked.
    
- **Virtual Playdates:** Our kids stay in touch with cousins through regular Minecraft sessions over video calls.
    
- **Cruising Communities:** Groups like [_Kids4Sail_](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Kids4Sail/) connect boating families and tools like the [_NoForeignLand_](https://www.noforeignland.com/discover) app help locate nearby kid boats.
    

One highlight was Halloween in Portsmouth, where we joined a group of kid boats for trick-or-treating. The kids went from boat to boat in costume and then explored the town together. Moments like this remind us that while finding community may take effort, it’s incredibly rewarding.

## Why We Chose This Life

Living on a boat with our family is about more than adventure. It’s about living intentionally, making memories, and spending time together in ways that wouldn’t be possible on land. Yes, there are challenges, but the rewards are beyond measure.

If you’re dreaming of the Great Loop—or any big adventure—my advice is this: Don’t wait for “someday.” Start planning now. You might be surprised by what’s possible.
