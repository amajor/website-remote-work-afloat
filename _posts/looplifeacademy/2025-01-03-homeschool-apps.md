When you’re cruising full-time, homeschooling and keeping kids connected with friends can feel like a juggling act. Luckily, there are some incredible apps and websites that make it easier to stay organized, educate on the go, and build a community.

Here’s a look at the tools we use on SV Fika to manage homeschooling and help our kids stay in touch with their friends and family. Maybe some of these apps will help you in your own homeschool (boatschool!) adventure!

### Finding Kid Boats: Nebo, NoForeignLand, and Kids4Sail

Finding other kid boats is a big priority for us—and not always easy! While [**Nebo**](https://www.nebo.global/) is fantastic for spotting other Loopers nearby, it doesn’t specifically highlight kid boats. That’s where [**NoForeignLand**](https://www.noforeignland.com/) comes in.

This app allows us to see other cruising boats in the area and includes groups like [**Kids4Sail**](https://www.facebook.com/groups/Kids4Sail/) to help identify families cruising with children. Through the app, I can message nearby kid boats or head over in our dinghy to introduce ourselves if they’re anchored nearby. It’s been an amazing way to connect with other families on the water and create instant playdates for the kids.

### Managing Homeschool: Khan Academy and Notion

Homeschooling while cruising offers so much flexibility, and there are endless resources to choose from. Here’s what’s working for us right now:

[**Khan Academy**](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is a cornerstone of our homeschooling routine, particularly for math and language arts. The courses are organized by grade level, and the parent dashboard makes it easy to track progress. I love how the lessons are broken down into clear units with exercises, quizzes, and tests—it’s structured yet flexible. Plus, it’s free!

I use [**Notion**](https://www.notion.com/), a customizable task management app to keep everything organized. I’ll be clear up front: this app isn’t for everyone. However, this app was a good fit for me after working in engineering and project management.

At the start of the school year, I spend some time mapping out the curriculum and adding URLs for Khan Academy lessons directly into Notion, plus other books and lesson plans we plan to cover. The kids can log in, see their daily tasks, and check things off as they go.

Here’s how I make it work:

1. **Create Assignments**: I list out tasks with links to online lessons or notes about book-based work.
    
2. **Assign Dates**: Each lesson is scheduled for a specific day.
    
3. **Track Progress**: The kids mark tasks as complete, and I review their work later, adding scores or notes as needed.
    

### Keeping in Touch: Messenger Kids

For social connection, my kids love [**Messenger Kids**](https://www.messengerkids.com/). This app is safe and kid-friendly, allowing them to message and video call only approved contacts, like their grandparents, cousins, or other boat kids we’ve met. It gives them a sense of independence while keeping everything secure and supervised.

Grandma loves it, too—it’s an easy way for her to chat or video call the kids without coordinating through us. The kids feel connected, and we feel confident knowing it’s all within our control.

### Final Thoughts

Homeschooling and staying connected on the water is all about finding what works for your family. For us, apps like **Khan Academy**, **Notion**, and **Messenger Kids** are game-changers, while **NoForeignLand** and **Kids4Sail** keep us connected to the cruising community.
