When it comes to navigation and weather on the Great Loop, preparation and redundancy are key. Over the years, we’ve tried a variety of apps and resources to help us navigate safely and plan for the weather.

Here’s what works for us and some other popular options among Loopers.

## 🗺️ Navigation Tools

### [Navionics Boating App](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/p/904463)

This is our go-to for digital charts and navigation. Navionics provides a wealth of information, from depth charts to marina details, all in a user-friendly format. It’s been our trusty companion on every leg of the Loop.

### [Aqua Map](https://www.aquamap.app/)

Although we don’t use Aqua Map as much, it’s a favorite among many Loopers. It’s worth checking out to see if it fits your style.

💡 _Tip:_ These apps are excellent resources, but don’t rely on them exclusively. Always cross-check your planned routes to ensure they’re safe and up-to-date.

## ⚓️ Anchor Monitoring

### [Hooked](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hooked-remote-anchor-alarm/id1666392079)

Another iOS app we love is Hooked, which we use for anchor watches. It allows us to set a pin where our anchor is dropped, and it sounds an alarm if our boat drifts out of the preset radius. This app gives me peace of mind during the night—no need to stay awake worrying about anchor drag when I know it’ll alert me if something goes wrong.

## ⛈️ Weather Forecasting

Weather plays a critical role in safe cruising, and we rely on a mix of apps to stay informed and prepared.

Using a combination of apps allows us to make well-rounded decisions, ensuring that we stay as safe and comfortable as possible while cruising.

### [AccuWeather](https://www.accuweather.com/)

**Accuweather** is our go-to for everyday weather updates and general conditions. It’s quick and easy to use, giving us a reliable overview of what to expect throughout the day. Whether it’s rain, temperature changes, or wind direction, this app helps us plan our basic activities (like whether to go to the park or the library).

### [Windy.App](https://windy.app/)

For more in-depth forecasting, we turn to **Windy.App** (the Windy app with the blue icon). This app excels at comparing different weather models, making it easier to understand wind patterns and predict waves and swell. Knowing these details is critical when planning passages, as it helps us anticipate how comfortable or uncomfortable the conditions might be on the water.

### [LuckGrib](https://luckgrib.com/)

When we need detailed weather data, we’ve come to appreciate **LuckGrib**. This app specializes in grib files, raw data files meteorologists use. It’s not as flashy as some other apps, but it provides incredible depth, helping us make informed decisions about weather windows and potential weather changes.

### [Chris Parker](https://www.mwxc.com/)

In Florida or along the Atlantic coast, we also rely on updates from **Chris Parker**, a trusted source for marine forecasts. His expertise is invaluable when we’re navigating areas exposed to the Atlantic, where weather can change quickly and dramatically. His updates give us confidence in planning safe and efficient routes.

### [WindHub](https://windhub.com/)

For longer passages, **WindHub** is an excellent tool. It provides detailed weather forecasts and lets us chart our route and see predicted conditions along the way. This feature is especially helpful for open-water sections like the Gulf of Mexico, side trips to the Bahamas, or stretches through the Great Lakes. It’s like having a personal weather navigator, keeping us informed and ready for what’s ahead.

## Extra Resources

### [Tides App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tide-charts/id957143504)

The Tides App is a clean, straightforward way for iPhone users to check tide levels and track sunrise and sunset times. This is especially handy for planning passages with significant tides, such as shallow inlets or coastal stretches.

### [Bob423 Tracks](https://bobicw.blogspot.com/p/how-to-download-tracks_28.html)

If traveling the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway (ICW), consider subscribing to Bob423. He updates his tracks yearly to highlight safe routes and areas with shoaling. Many Loopers use and appreciate his resources.

## Backup Plans and Redundancy

One of the most important lessons on the Loop is always having a backup plan for navigation and weather tools. What will you do if your primary device fails?

We’ve equipped ourselves with multiple iPads, iPhones, and a dedicated chartplotter to ensure we always have a way to navigate, even if something breaks or malfunctions.

💡 _Pro Tip:_ Redundancy builds confidence. If you’ve considered what to do in an emergency, you’ll stay calmer and more focused when it matters most.
