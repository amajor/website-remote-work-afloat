# Remote Work Afloat

### Staying Connected on the Water Isn’t Always Easy…

You’re ready to take your work beyond the office and onto the water—whether that means cruising full-time, taking a year on the Great Loop, or working remotely from a boat whenever you can. The dream is there, but so are the questions:

- How do you stay connected when marinas have unreliable Wi-Fi?

- What’s the best way to set up internet that actually works offshore?

- How do you balance work and adventure without feeling like you’re missing out?

### …And If You Get It Wrong, It Can Be Frustrating

Dropped Zoom calls, slow internet, dead batteries—nothing ruins the freedom of working from a boat faster than struggling with your setup. Without a solid plan, you could end up wasting money on gear that doesn’t work for your needs or feeling stuck at marinas when you’d rather be anchored in a beautiful cove.

### This Book Gives You a Plan That Works

In Remote Work Afloat, I break down exactly how to set up and thrive while working from a boat. You’ll get real-world advice from someone who’s lived it—covering internet solutions, power management, workspace setup, and the logistics of balancing work with life on the water. No fluff, just practical strategies to keep you connected, productive, and free to enjoy the cruising lifestyle.

### So You Can Focus on the Life You Want to Live

Imagine logging off at the end of the day and stepping outside to watch the sunset over the water. Imagine having the confidence to work remotely from a peaceful anchorage, knowing your connection is solid. With the right setup, you don’t have to choose between adventure and your career—you can have both.
