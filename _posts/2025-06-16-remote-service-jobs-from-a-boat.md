_Flexible careers with a personal touch._

### Assisting Roles for Life on the Water

Some of the best remote careers are also the most personal. You don’t have to be an influencer or a software developer to earn a living from your boat—you just need a skill that helps someone else save time, solve a problem, or feel more confident.

These service-based roles are flexible, in-demand, and boat-friendly. Most of them require only a laptop, solid communication, and the ability to stick to your client’s deadlines (even when you’re swinging at anchor).

Whether you’re naturally organized, creatively inclined, or tech-curious, there’s something here for you.

### Here are 10 Service Role Ideas that work well from a boat!

#### 📄 Resume Writer

Help job seekers put their best foot forward by writing (or rewriting) resumes, cover letters, and LinkedIn profiles. Great for anyone with a knack for writing and editing—and you can niche down by industry, experience level, or type of job.

#### 👗 Personal Stylist (via video consults)

Got an eye for fashion or helping people feel confident? Many stylists now offer virtual wardrobe audits, shopping guides, and video consults. Ideal for anyone with a creative streak and a passion for helping others feel their best.

#### 🤝 Virtual Assistants for Coaches or Creators

Many small business owners—especially coaches, educators, and creators—are looking for reliable, detail-oriented virtual assistants. Tasks might include email management, social media, client follow-up, or scheduling. You can specialize and build long-term relationships with just a few clients.

#### 🧱 Notion Consultant

If you’re obsessed with organizing things in Notion (and love building dashboards, templates, or client portals), this is a growing niche. Coaches, small business owners, and solopreneurs are hiring Notion-savvy freelancers to help streamline their work.

#### 💻 Tech Support for Small Businesses

You don’t need to be an IT wizard—just someone who’s confident troubleshooting basic tech problems, setting up tools, or training others to use platforms like Squarespace, Google Workspace, or email systems. Ideal if you’re the “techie” among your friends.

#### 🎙️ Podcast Editor

If you have a good ear and enjoy audio work, podcast editing can be done from anywhere with the right software and a pair of headphones. You don’t need a professional studio—just consistency, clear communication, and the ability to meet deadlines.

#### 📬 Email Marketer

Many creators and small businesses need help crafting regular newsletters, setting up email automations, and writing sales sequences. This is a great niche if you enjoy writing, strategy, and analytics—and it’s all doable with a laptop and a hotspot.

#### 📚 Online Bookkeeper

If you’re detail-oriented and comfortable with numbers, online bookkeeping is a solid, steady option. With tools like QuickBooks, Wave, or Xero, you can manage small business finances from anywhere. Bonus if you like building systems and organizing receipts!

#### 📌 Pinterest Virtual Assistant

Pinterest is a search engine, not a social platform—which makes it perfect for long-term content strategies. Many bloggers and ecommerce sellers hire virtual assistants to manage pin designs, scheduling, and board organization. A visual eye and basic Canva skills go a long way here.

#### 🛒 Shopify Consultant

If you’ve built an ecommerce store or know your way around Shopify, you can help new store owners get set up, troubleshoot issues, or optimize their online presence. It’s a great niche if you enjoy digital tools, design, or ecommerce strategy.

### ⚓ You Don’t Need to “Scale” to Succeed

There’s no pressure to build a huge brand or an agency. These service-based roles work great for solopreneurs, freelancers, or part-time cruisers who just want steady income and meaningful work.

Offer something simple. Do it well. Communicate clearly. Then go for a swim.
