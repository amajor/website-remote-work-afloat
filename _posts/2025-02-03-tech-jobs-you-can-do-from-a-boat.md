### Working in Tech While Living Afloat

One of the most common questions we get from people dreaming about cruising is: _“What kind of work can I do from a boat?”_ And if you already work in tech, the answer is probably what you’re already doing.

Tech jobs are some of the most portable, flexible careers out there. With the right setup (and a little patience for unpredictable internet), you can write code, run tests, manage projects, or analyze data all from your floating office—with a much better view than a cubicle.

Most of the folks we meet who work full-time from their boats are in tech or tech-adjacent roles. Some are freelancers, some are full-time employees, and others run their own businesses. The key is being able to work asynchronously when needed, troubleshoot on the fly, and set up your tech stack to handle spotty marina Wi-Fi or days underway with a weak signal.

### Here are 10 Tech Careers that work well from a boat!

#### **🖥️** Software Development

If you’re a developer, odds are you can work from anywhere. Many companies are remote-first or offer flexible arrangements, especially if you’re in web or mobile development. As long as you can push code and attend occasional standups, you’re golden.

> **Tip from the boat:** Offshore backups and a local development environment are your best friends. Don’t rely on cloud access for everything.

#### **🌐** Web Development

Whether you’re building websites for clients, working with agencies, or managing your own projects, web development is an ideal afloat career. WordPress, Shopify, React, Vue—it all works from your boat as long as you do.

#### **📱** App Development

Mobile developers can design, test, and release apps from just about anywhere. You might need to schedule uploads or tests around marina Wi-Fi or anchorages with a good signal, but day-to-day coding is highly portable.

#### **🧠** UX/UI Design

If you’re working on wireframes, user flows, or product design, this can all be done remotely with tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Miro. It’s a visual job, but mostly low-bandwidth—just make sure you’ve downloaded your assets before leaving the dock.

#### **📊** Data Analysis

Data analysts can work from anywhere with the right access to tools and data sets. SQL, Python, R, Tableau, spreadsheets—whatever your stack, you can crunch numbers and build dashboards from your floating home office.

#### **☁️** Cloud Engineering

Cloud engineers often live in, well, the cloud. If you’ve got a good workflow and the right credentials stored safely, you can provision and manage resources from just about anywhere. Be mindful of security and always have a secure VPN.

#### **🧪** QA Testing

Running test scripts, reporting bugs, and building out test plans is mostly asynchronous and remote-friendly. Some teams may require live testing windows or collaboration, but much of QA can be done on your own schedule.

#### **🛠️** IT Support

If you’re offering IT support for users or clients remotely, a boat can be a surprisingly productive place to do it. Just be sure you’ve got enough signal to jump on a screen share or handle tickets during peak support times.

#### **🔄** DevOps

Working in CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, or automation? DevOps pros can work from anywhere with a solid terminal, good documentation, and reliable connections. Just make sure you have backups for everything—and that includes power.

#### **📋** Tech Project Management

If you’re a project manager or scrum master working with dev teams, you’ll be at home afloat. Tools like Jira, Trello, Notion, and Slack make it easy to run standups, manage sprints, and communicate with teams spread across the globe—just like you.

> **Boat bonus:** I’ve worked full-time in tech from a moving boat, managed product launches from remote anchorages, and taken Zoom meetings from library corners. It’s all possible—it just takes some flexibility and planning.

### Reality Check: Internet Matters

Internet is the biggest factor in making this kind of work-from-boat lifestyle possible. You don’t need it 24/7, but you do need a plan for staying connected when it counts—whether that means [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57), marina Wi-Fi, mobile hotspots, or a rotating list of coffee shops and libraries.

### Final Thoughts

Tech jobs are some of the most boat-friendly careers out there. If you’ve already got the skills, the biggest shift is less about the work—and more about the logistics. But once you’re set up, your “office” can be anywhere from a quiet anchorage in Georgia to a dock in Chicago.
