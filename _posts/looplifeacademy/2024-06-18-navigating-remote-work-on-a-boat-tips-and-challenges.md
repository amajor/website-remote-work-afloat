Many dream about living full-time on a boat, but fewer embrace it. With the modern rise of remote work, life on a boat while cruising is more attainable than ever. I have worked remotely for over a decade, even before it became popular. By leveraging available remote work options, I've made the last year of living on a boat possible.

### Key to Success: Internet Connectivity

The primary key to success in remote work from a boat is internet connectivity. Remote working depends on connecting to the resources you need from wherever you are. In the past, solutions included cellular providers and limited satellite options. [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) is the most popular choice today due to its easy setup and reliability. While [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) alone may be sufficient, backup options can improve reliability and offer redundancy.

### Setting Up Your Workstation

Your workstation setup is secondary to your internet connection but still important. Some workers prefer a dedicated station with external monitors. Due to digital navigation options (no more paper charts!), nav desks, common on cruiser-ready boats, are now often used for workstations. Setting up your monitor at an ideal height and using supportive seat cushions is crucial for long days at the desk. Moving around the boat for a change of scenery or sharing a workspace with a partner can also be beneficial.

### Balancing Work and Cruising

Balancing cruising and working full-time presents challenges. Your work time will often compete with leisure activities, boat work, or the need to move to the next anchorage. Scheduling boat movements around work requirements is essential, as you can't be at the helm while working. For those with a family crew, the emotional challenge of working while others enjoy leisure activities must be managed. Our family balances this by having the kids work on school assignments during work hours or planning quiet activities during essential meetings.

### Flexibility and Risk Management

Flexibility in managing work and the nomadic lifestyle is crucial. Sometimes, spotty WiFi or bad weather requires creativity and adaptability. I've been fortunate to have a supportive team in my software engineering job that understands occasional difficulties. Taking calculated risks and being open to adapting plans has made this lifestyle work for us.

### Remote Work Career Ideas

Modern times offer many options for remote work careers. Technology roles like software engineering, IT, AutoCAD, and digital design are obvious choices. Other roles, such as writing, project management, data entry, and consultation, are also viable. Assess your skills and search for remote work ideas that suit you.

### Maintaining Professional Standards

While remote work standards have relaxed somewhat since the pandemic, maintaining professionalism is essential. Effective communication, especially in video calls, is crucial. Here are some tips:

- Ask for feedback on call quality.
    
- Use voice isolation on your microphone.
    
- Have a backup internet connection.
    
- Limit bandwidth use by turning off video or using apps like [TripMode](https://tripmode.ch/).
    
- Avoid relying on marina or public WiFi.
    

### Conclusion

Once you find a setup that works for you, you'll fall into a routine with your crew and work team, making this lifestyle unforgettable. With modern options, remote work on a boat is a viable and rewarding lifestyle for many, not just retirees or those with hired crew.
