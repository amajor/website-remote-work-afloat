  - name: Mobile Hotspot
    description: "A mobile hotspot is an essential tool for boat life, allowing you to convert a cellular data connection into Wi-Fi for multiple devices. While many smartphones have a built-in hotspot feature, standalone mobile hotspots are more powerful and reliable, especially when you need to support multiple devices. These devices are lifesavers when you’re anchored far from shore or in a location without traditional Wi-Fi. Look for models that have long battery life and strong signal capabilities to make the most of your internet connection."

  - name: SIM Cards
    description: "SIM cards are your gateway to cellular networks around the world, and having the right ones can make all the difference when cruising. Depending on where you’re traveling, consider getting local SIM cards or an international plan to get the best coverage and rates. Some services offer data SIMs specifically for travelers, giving you the flexibility to choose the best options for your internet needs while you’re on the water."

  - name: Signal Booster / Cellular Repeater
    description: "When you’re relying on cellular data for internet access, weak signals can be a major frustration. A signal booster or cellular repeater solves this problem by capturing a weak signal, amplifying it, and rebroadcasting it inside your boat. It can significantly improve reception and speeds, which is especially helpful in remote areas where cellular coverage is limited. If you’re in an area with marginal service, a signal booster might be just the thing to give you the reliable connection you need to stay productive."

  - name: Routers
    description: "A good router is key to ensuring you have a strong and reliable Wi-Fi connection throughout your boat. The router acts as the central hub for all your devices, whether you’re working on your laptop, streaming, or checking email. Look for one with dual-band capabilities to reduce interference and keep your connection stable even when you’re at anchor. Some routers also have marine-grade options that are built to withstand the harsh conditions of life on the water. You’ll need a solid router to handle your onboard network and ensure all your devices stay connected."

  - name: Range Extenders
    description: "If you’re already connected to a Wi-Fi network but need to ensure it reaches every part of your boat, a Wi-Fi range extender is a must. This device amplifies the signal from your router or an external Wi-Fi source, ensuring reliable coverage even in remote areas of your boat, like the far corners or outdoor spaces. For life on the water, make sure to choose a marine-grade range extender designed to handle the elements. Experiment with placement and test signal strength to make sure you’re getting the best performance out of your setup."

  - name: Ethernet Cables
    description: "Though Wi-Fi is convenient, nothing beats the reliability and speed of a wired Ethernet connection. If you need the most stable internet possible, using an Ethernet cable can ensure you get the best speeds and performance, especially for tasks like video calls or large file uploads. Many routers and devices can be connected via Ethernet, and it’s a great option for setting up a fixed workspace on the boat. Whether you’re docked or on a stable anchor, using an Ethernet cable can help you avoid any Wi-Fi hiccups."

    link: https://amzn.to/4ifv2PY

  - name: Inverters
    description: "Inverters are essential for using AC-powered devices like laptops or coffee makers on a boat. They convert your boat’s DC power into the AC power that household electronics need. Just keep in mind that inverters pull from your battery bank, so it’s important to manage their use, especially when you’re off the grid and trying to conserve energy."
    link: https://amzn.to/3Xo7FMe

  - name: Generator
    description: "A portable generator is a great backup when your solar panels or inverter can’t keep up. We use ours for extra power, whether charging the central battery bank or running devices like Starlink. Generators can be noisy, so always check local marina rules before firing them. Safety is key—never run a generator in an enclosed space due to the risk of carbon monoxide. We prefer the Honda generator, but if you can’t get that, try for Generac."
    link: https://amzn.to/43gLMCm

  - name: High-Output Alternators
    description: "High-output alternators are a game-changer for keeping your house batteries topped up while cruising. They provide a steady stream of power to recharge batteries as you’re underway, making it easier to manage power needs without relying solely on solar or a generator. If you’re cruising a lot, it’s definitely worth considering for more consistent power on the go."
