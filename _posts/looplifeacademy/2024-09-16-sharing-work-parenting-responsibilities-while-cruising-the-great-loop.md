In this post, we’re exploring a key topic for families cruising the Great Loop: how to effectively collaborate with your partner to manage work and parenting while living on the move.

Whether navigating the boat, homeschooling the kids, or juggling remote work, finding the right balance between responsibilities can be challenging. We’ll explore clear communication, time management, and teamwork strategies to help you and your partner stay productive, reduce stress, and create a smoother experience for the whole family as you cruise.

This is especially important for Loopers because, with frequent travel days, ever-changing schedules, and the added task of homeschooling, finding ways to work together and stay flexible is crucial.

Let’s explore how to make it all happen while embracing the adventure!

### 1️⃣ Clear Communication & Setting Expectations

As any Looper knows, clear communication is essential when living on a boat. You’ve likely seen the shirts that say, _“I’m sorry for what I said while docking the boat,”_ or heard of headsets that many call _“marriage savers”_ to avoid shouting across the deck.

But open, ongoing communication isn’t just for the boat—it’s also crucial for setting expectations around work, family, and personal time. Setting clear expectations with your partner helps prevent misunderstandings. It ensures you know who is responsible for what, especially when managing kids and homeschooling on top of boat duties.

On the Loop, communication becomes even more critical when planning travel days. You’ll need to decide in advance, or even day-by-day, who will handle boat navigation, manage the kids during passages, and how to fit in homeschooling and work around these plans. For instance, during the first half of our Loop, I worked full-time on weekdays while Chris handled boat navigation. We made sure our kids had activities to keep them engaged during travel, and we would swap roles when needed.

Flexibility is key here. For example, cruising through the river system in late October was so cold that we kept our diesel furnace was running inside. Chris was at the helm outside, and I would use my lunch break to give him a chance to warm up inside while I enjoyed time out on the deck.

Agreeing on a flexible, adaptable plan for each leg of your journey, both partners stay aligned and work together smoothly.

### 2️⃣ Scheduling & Time Blocking

Creating a shared schedule that blocks off specific times for work, childcare, and homeschool is crucial for keeping everything balanced. But while this is important, especially for time-sensitive activities like meetings, live classes, or lock openings, a rigid schedule isn’t always feasible on the Loop.

Here are some tips for staying flexible with your schedule while traveling:

🧭 **Set Loose Daily Goals, Not Strict Schedules  
**Instead of adhering to a strict routine, outline general goals for the day. For example, aim to cruise in the morning and focus on homeschooling in the afternoon, but be ready to shift if weather or other factors demand it.

⏳ **Use Short Time Blocks  
**Break your day into smaller blocks (30-60 minutes) to work around travel. You can use calmer travel periods to fit in work tasks and homeschool lessons during breaks at locks or when anchored.

🛟 **Build Buffer Time  
**Always plan for extra time when traveling. Unexpected delays like weather changes or slower cruising speeds can disrupt plans. Buffer time helps reduce stress when things don’t go as expected.

🌦️ **Stay Adaptable to Weather Windows  
**The weather will often dictate your travel plans on the Loop. Use non-travel days to catch up on work, homeschool, or boat maintenance. Alternatively, stay put on busy workdays and use those times to get through homeschooling or land-based activities with the kids.

✅ **Prioritize Key Tasks  
**Focus on the most important tasks each day—whether it’s a work deadline or a specific homeschool lesson. Write down your top three goals for the day and get those done first. Other tasks can be flexible and moved if plans change.

🤝 **Tag Team Responsibilities  
**Swap tasks with your partner when needed. One person can manage homeschooling or childcare while the other handles boat work or focuses time on a project. When anchored for a few days, Chris and I often check in with each other to see if one of us needs deep focus time while the other takes the kids out for an activity like visiting a maritime museum or going paddleboarding.

🌙 **Use Down Time Wisely  
**Take advantage of quieter moments, such as when docked or anchored for the night, to catch up on work or homeschool. Early mornings and evenings can be great times for focused tasks.

🌍 **Embrace the Unplanned  
**Some of the best experiences come from unexpected changes to your plans. Delays or detours can open opportunities for exploration or valuable family time.

### 3️⃣ Teamwork & Flexibility

Maintaining a teamwork mentality is essential for the entire crew, especially for both partners when balancing work and parenting. Both of you need to be ready to adjust and swap duties when necessary, whether that’s stepping in for a homeschooling session, taking over navigation, or covering meal prep when the other is facing a deadline.

The unpredictability of life on the Loop—whether it’s a longer travel day, boat repairs, or last-minute route changes—means that being flexible is crucial. Sharing responsibilities and adapting to unexpected challenges helps keep the boat (and family) running smoothly.

### 💭 Final Thoughts: Team Work Makes the Dream Work!

Balancing work, parenting, and homeschooling on the Great Loop is no small task, but with the right communication, scheduling, and teamwork, you and your partner can create a smooth and rewarding routine.
