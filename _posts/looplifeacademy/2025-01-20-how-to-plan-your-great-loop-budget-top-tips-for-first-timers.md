Taking on the Great Loop is an exciting adventure, but it’s also a big financial commitment. For first-time Loopers, understanding the potential costs and setting a solid budget are key to ensuring their journey stays on track financially.

The good news is that with careful planning and flexibility, you can manage your spending while enjoying everything the Great Loop has to offer.

Here are my top tips for planning your Great Loop budget:

### Choosing Between Marinas and Anchorages

One of the biggest choices that will impact your budget on the Great Loop is where you decide to stay—marinas or anchorages. If you’re looking to save money, staying at anchorages is free and can give you that peaceful, secluded experience. But, of course, staying at marinas comes with a cost. Fees vary widely depending on location and boat size, with larger boats paying more.

When planning your budget, it’s important to balance the two. A good rule of thumb is to stay at marinas when you need amenities like showers, laundry, or safe docking during rough weather, but otherwise, try to anchor out. You might end up spending more on marina fees, but the tradeoff in convenience could be worth it for your trip’s comfort.

### Fuel Consumption: Bigger Boat, Bigger Costs

The type of boat you choose will also play a significant role in your budget, especially when it comes to fuel consumption. A large motor yacht with big engines is likely to burn through fuel quickly, adding to your costs. On the other hand, smaller boats like trawlers or sailboats tend to be much more fuel-efficient.

Before you leave, research your boat’s fuel consumption to get a better idea of how much you’ll need for each leg of your journey. With the Great Loop’s varying waterways and distances, some sections require longer fuel runs, so it’s a good idea to plan for the fuel capacity you’ll need for each leg. If you’re unsure about your boat’s fuel efficiency, consider getting a smaller boat or a more fuel-efficient one to keep your costs down.

### Provisioning: Cooking on the Boat vs. Dining Out

Another significant part of your budget will be provisioning. Most Loopers rely on stocking up at grocery stores along the route and cooking meals on board, which can be much cheaper than eating out regularly. If you’d prefer to eat out, those restaurant bills can add up fast if you plan on dining out more frequently.

A great way to manage your provisioning is by creating a meal plan incorporating easy-to-prepare dishes and local ingredients from markets. Depending on where you are on the Loop, you might find great local produce or unique foods to try. Keep in mind that some marinas and anchorages have restaurants, so it’s good to plan meals with room for a night out now and then.

### Don’t Forget Boat Maintenance!

Maintaining your boat is another expense you need to keep in mind when planning your budget. From routine maintenance like oil changes to unexpected repairs, you’ll need to set aside some funds to keep your boat in good condition.

Try to schedule routine checks and maintenance during marina stays so that you have access to resources, and set aside an emergency fund for any repairs that may come up. Regular maintenance will ensure your boat runs smoothly throughout the trip, helping you avoid costly breakdowns or delays.

While the costs of the Great Loop can vary depending on your choices, proper planning and flexibility will go a long way. Stay mindful of your marina stays, fuel consumption, provisioning, and maintenance to keep your budget under control.

By taking the time to plan and adjust your expectations, you can focus more on the adventure and less on the financial stress. Happy looping!
