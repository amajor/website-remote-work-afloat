[Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) has become a hot topic in the cruising world—and for good reason. This satellite internet system has completely changed the game for boaters who need to stay connected while underway or anchored in remote places. But it’s not magic, and it’s not always the right solution for every cruiser.

Here’s what we’ve learned after thousands of nautical miles with [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) on board: the gear, the setup, and how to tell if it’s really worth the investment for your adventure.

### What Is Starlink—and Why Boaters Care

If you haven’t heard of [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57), it’s a low-earth-orbit satellite internet service developed by SpaceX. Unlike traditional satellite internet, [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) offers relatively fast speeds, decent latency, and—best of all—global coverage. That’s huge for cruisers, especially those who live aboard or travel long distances.

While marina Wi-Fi and cellular boosters can work well in many places, they tend to fall apart once you’re offshore, on the hook in a remote anchorage, or navigating through countries with limited cellular infrastructure. [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) gives you internet almost anywhere with a clear view of the sky. That means you can attend a Zoom meeting from a secluded cove, send your homeschooling portfolio from the middle of the ICW, or upload a YouTube video from your mooring ball.

### Understanding Starlink Plans for Boats

Not all [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) service is created equal—especially for mobile users. When you sign up, you’ll choose from different service types depending on how you plan to use it:

- **Roam (Mobile)**: What most cruisers use. This plan allows you to move around and still stay connected.
    
- **Mobile Regional vs. Global**: Regional is cheaper but only works in your home country. Global is more expensive but covers international waters.
    
- **Flat High Performance**: Designed specifically for mobility (vehicles, boats). Better for motion and extreme temperatures.
    
- **Pause/Unpause Option**: Mobile plans can be paused when you’re not using them (like when your boat’s on the hard or you’re cruising inland with other options).
    

If you’re mostly coastal cruising or doing the Loop, the Mobile Regional plan might be enough. If you’re heading offshore, into the Bahamas, or abroad, Global might be the better fit, though we’ve been able to use [Starlink Roam](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) in our travels throughout the US and the Bahamas.

### Our Onboard Starlink Setup

We use the **older Mobile Roam dish**, mounted on our stern arch with a clear view of the sky. The flat version is more expensive but designed to work in motion—which is helpful if you want to keep a signal underway or don’t want to manually set up your dish every time you anchor, but even the articulating dishes usually have an option in the app to put them in flat mode.

We power ours using DC power and have it tied directly to our switchboard and keep it off unless we need to work or stream something specific. [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) draws a decent amount of power (50–100 watts), so if you’re living off solar, that’s worth considering.

When we first set it up, we used the basic mounting brackets and zip ties, testing the best placement for sky visibility. It worked almost instantly once powered up.

### When Starlink Is (and Isn’t) Worth It

There’s no question that [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) can make remote work and long-term cruising easier. But it’s not cheap, and it’s not the best tool for every type of cruiser.

**Worth it if:**

- You work from your boat and need reliable internet
    
- You homeschool, livestream, or need to upload content regularly
    
- You cruise in remote places where cell signal is spotty or nonexistent
    
- You’re a full-time liveaboard who values redundancy
    

**Maybe skip it if:**

- You mostly cruise near populated areas with strong cell coverage
    
- You’re on a strict budget and don’t need internet 24/7
    
- You’re happy relying on marina Wi-Fi and cell data for occasional check-ins
    

### Backup Internet Is Still Important

Even with [Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57), we keep a **cellular data plan** (we use a Pepwave router and SIM cards for different carriers) because it’s still faster and more reliable in some urban or near-shore settings. Having both gives us a backup in case one fails—and it helps manage power consumption too.

We also occasionally rely on marina Wi-Fi, though it’s hit-or-miss depending on location.

### Final Thoughts

[Starlink](https://www.starlink.com/roam?referral=RC-2020659-90333-57) isn’t perfect, but it’s made working and schooling from our boat significantly easier—and less stressful. It’s allowed us to be more flexible with our routes, spend more time in beautiful but disconnected places, and stay in touch with family while crossing borders.

If you’re trying to decide whether Starlink is worth it for you, think about how often you need to be online, where you plan to cruise, and how tech-savvy you are with setup and troubleshooting.
