## **FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

#### **New Book Remote Work Afloat Helps Aspiring Loopers & Cruisers Work from the Water**

**March 2025** – For boaters dreaming of cruising full-time while keeping their careers afloat, [**_Remote Work Afloat_**_: How to Set Up and Thrive While Working from a Boat_](https://www.remoteworkafloat.com/) is now available! Written by experienced liveaboard and Gold Looper Alison Major, this essential guide breaks down everything you need to know about balancing work with life on the water.

From reliable internet solutions to workspace setup, power management, and scheduling around cruising plans, [**_Remote Work Afloat_**](https://www.remoteworkafloat.com/) provides real-world strategies for making remote work possible—whether you’re tackling America’s Great Loop, coastal cruising, or planning extended time aboard.

“When I started working from a boat, there wasn’t a single resource that covered everything I needed to know,” says Major. “I had to piece it together—talking to other sailors, digging through forums, reading blog posts, and watching YouTube videos. And even then, a lot of it was trial and error once we moved aboard. I wrote this book to make that process easier for others, so they can skip the guesswork and confidently balance work and cruising without putting their careers on hold.”

Inside [**_Remote Work Afloat_**](https://www.remoteworkafloat.com/), readers will learn:

- How to stay connected from anchorages, marinas, and offshore
    
- Power solutions to keep laptops, Wi-Fi, and other essentials running
    
- Creating a productive workspace (even in a small boat!)
    
- How to schedule work around weather, travel plans, and marina stays
    
- Tips for business travel when you need to be on land
    
- Boat selection considerations for working cruisers
    

Major, who completed the Great Loop with her family aboard their sailboat, shares firsthand insights and lessons learned from working remotely while cruising. This book is designed for Loopers, coastal cruisers, and digital nomads looking to make remote work on the water a reality.

[**_Remote Work Afloat_**](https://www.remoteworkafloat.com/) is now available in eBook format and will be published in print later this summer. Learn more or order your copy at [remoteworkafloat.com](https://remoteworkafloat.com/).

Alison Major is a writer, educator, and experienced liveaboard sailor who completed the Great Loop with her family. She helps aspiring cruisers transition to life on the water through her platform, [_Loop Life Academy_](https://www.looplifeacademy.com/).
