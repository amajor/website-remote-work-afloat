_Great for folks who aren’t super tech-savvy but want to work online._

### Internet Work with Minimal Tech Skills

Not everyone dreaming of life on the water is a tech expert—and that’s okay. The good news is that there are plenty of remote jobs that don’t require advanced software skills, coding knowledge, or creative tools. If you’re organized, dependable, and comfortable communicating with people, you already have the foundation for many afloat-friendly careers.

Here are some great options for folks who aren’t super tech-savvy but want to work online while living on a boat.

### Here are 10 Remote Careers with Minimal Tech Skills that work well from a boat!

#### 💬 Remote Customer Service

Companies of all sizes hire customer service reps to help with phone calls, live chat, or email support. These roles usually require a stable internet connection, a quiet environment, and strong communication skills. Most platforms offer training, and you’ll typically work from a script or support knowledge base.

#### 📋 Data Entry

Data entry jobs are perfect if you’re detail-oriented and good at repetitive tasks. You’ll enter information into spreadsheets, CRMs, or other systems. It’s not glamorous, but it’s a steady way to earn income with minimal tech skills.

#### 📧 Email Support

Similar to customer service, email support specialists help answer customer questions, troubleshoot issues, and resolve concerns—all through email. You may work for a single brand or as part of a third-party support agency.

#### 🎧 Transcription

If you have good listening and typing skills, transcription might be a fit. You’ll listen to audio (like interviews or podcasts) and type what you hear. Some roles are general, while others focus on legal or medical transcription, which may require specialized knowledge.

#### 🌐 Online Moderation

Social media platforms, online forums, and digital communities often hire moderators to help monitor content, remove spam, and enforce community guidelines. It’s a great job for those who like structure and don’t mind repetitive tasks.

#### ✅ Content Reviewing

Similar to moderation, content reviewers help assess user-generated content for platforms like YouTube, Facebook, or TikTok. These roles may involve flagging inappropriate material or categorizing content based on specific guidelines.

#### 📅 Appointment Setting

Many entrepreneurs and small businesses hire virtual assistants to handle calendar management and set appointments with clients. This role is mostly about coordination and communication—not tech wizardry.

#### 🛍️ Marketplace Support

Have experience selling or buying on platforms like Etsy, eBay, or Poshmark? Some remote workers assist with listing products, responding to customers, or managing small online storefronts.

#### ✈️ Travel Booking Assistant

If you love planning and organizing, this one’s for you. Help clients book flights, hotels, and tours. You don’t have to be a full-fledged travel agent—just someone who’s detail-oriented and responsive.

#### 🧪 Survey Participant / Product Tester

It won’t replace a full-time job, but participating in paid surveys or testing new products can be a great side hustle for boaters. These usually involve answering questions or trying out new tools or gadgets and reporting your experience.

### **🏁** Work From the Water—No Tech Degree Needed

You don’t need to be a digital nomad guru to work from your boat. With so many online roles that rely on consistency and communication—not coding—you can build a remote career that fits your lifestyle. Whether you’re helping customers, organizing data, or reviewing content, there’s room for you in the world of online work.
