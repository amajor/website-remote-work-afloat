    - name: Laptop & Power Cord
      description: "A laptop is the heart of your remote office. It is portable, space-saving, and essential for working on a boat. Choose one with a clear display, long battery life, and enough processing power for your needs. Keep in mind that humidity and salty air can shorten its lifespan."

    - name: Desktop Computer
      description: "If a desktop is essential for your work, be mindful of its size and power demands. Desktops can drain your battery bank quickly, so ensure you have a reliable power source like solar, wind, or a generator. For most remote jobs, though, a laptop is sufficient and often supplied by your employer."

    - name: External Monitor
      description: "An external monitor can boost productivity by providing extra screen space and a more ergonomic setup. However, many are power-hungry, so if you’re at anchor, plan for the energy impact, especially when relying on solar or a generator."

    - name: Monitor Mount
      description: "If you do go with an external monitor, invest in a monitor mount. It secures your screen, keeps it from sliding if your boat rocks, and lets you position it at an ergonomic height. Trust me—on a boat, anything not tied down has the potential to become a projectile, even on calm days when an unexpected wake rolls in."

    - name: Bone-Conducting Headphones

I use Shokz Minis as they fit my head size better, so double-check your size options."
