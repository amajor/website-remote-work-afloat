One of the biggest stress points when we first moved aboard wasn’t the small space or the weather windows or even homeschooling on the move… it was the internet.

Trying to work remotely while cruising means you’re constantly juggling marina Wi-Fi, Starlink, and cellular service. And if you have a family with many devices (hi, that’s us), the last thing you want is to reconnect everything every time you switch to a different connection.

A good onboard router solves that problem.

It gives you one Wi-Fi network on the boat that everything connects to, and the router handles switching between Starlink, marina Wi-Fi, and cellular behind the scenes. Life-changing.

In this post, I’m walking through the basics, what we personally use aboard SV Fika, and a few real-world recommendations from other long-term cruisers and remote workers.

## Our Setup Aboard SV Fika

We run a Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2. And yes, it’s an older Peplink model.

We actually bought it from another cruiser who upgraded to a newer unit, but honestly…it still works great. It handles:

- Starlink (hardwired)
- Marina Wi-Fi (as a WAN input)
- Cellular (via SIM card)

If you want a peek behind the scenes, I did a short walkthrough video last year showing how I added a marina Wi-Fi network as a fallback option in the Peplink interface. You can watch it here:

## Bonding vs. Failover (What These Routers Actually Do)

Router terminology gets confusing fast, especially when you’re trying to compare different brands. Here’s the simple version:

### Bonding

- Combines multiple internet sources (like Starlink + cellular) into one “bigger” connection
- Uses all connections at the same time
- More reliable and potentially faster
- Requires the right plan + the right hardware
- Peplink has a great explainer video if you want to dive deeper

### Failover

- Uses one connection at a time
- Switches to the backup only if the primary fails
- More affordable
- Slight pause during the switch

A lot of cruisers don’t actually need bonding; failover is plenty. And failover is what most entry-level Peplink models do exceptionally well.

## What Other Cruisers Are Using Right Now

I asked a couple of long-term, working cruisers and nomads what they used this past season. Here’s what they said:

### Peplink Options

The main drawbacks of using Peplink routers are that they are marketed for businesses and commercial installations, and many models differ only slightly, making it challenging to narrow down the best solutions for your specific situation.

As I mentioned earlier, we have the **Pepwave MAX BR1 MK2**, mostly because we got it at a good deal (used) at a convenient time.

The [MAX BR1 Mini Setup](https://amzn.to/4iEKW7T) is a newer version of the model we have on _SV Fika_. The digital nomad with this router used a T-Mobile chip from a purchased hotspot and hardwired Starlink to the router. They also use it to connect to their cellular hotspot when needed.

This is a great “middle of the road” option. Not as pricey as some, but still robust.

### An Affordable Alternative (Non-Peplink)

One more budget-friendly recommendation is the [GL-X3000 (Spitz AX) Cellular Gateway 5G Router](https://amzn.to/3KJ5q2M). However, Amazon does note that this item is frequently returned, so do your research before diving in. This one does a lot of the same things as Pepwave (supports Starlink, SIM cards, or other Wi-Fi access points) and is much cheaper, aimed at consumers rather than commercial installations.

The cruiser that uses the above option also added an essential note for international cruisers when I talked with them:

> “T-Mobile (which is a good choice internationally) blocks Cat18 modems, which some of the newer Pepwave models use.”

Translation: sometimes newer isn’t better.

## So…What Should You Get?

Here’s the quick guide:

### If you want simple and solid:

**Peplink MAX BR1 Mini**

Reliable, proven, not overkill.

You can find and compare Peplink models on their website, [here](https://www.peplink.com/compare/routers/?product=BR1%20Mini&product=B%20One&product=BR1%20MK2).

### If you’re on a budget or don’t need commercial-grade gear:

The Amazon alternative above is worth a look.

### If you only want one takeaway:

You want a router that can handle:

**Starlink + marina Wi-Fi + cellular**

…and give you **one consistent Wi-Fi network** inside the boat.

That’s the magic combination for remote work afloat.

## Final Thoughts

There are a lot of ways to set up internet on a boat, and there’s no single “perfect” solution. What matters most is:

- Redundancy (always have at least 2 connections)
- Simplicity (one Wi-Fi network onboard)
- Flexibility (switch sources without reconnecting all your devices)
