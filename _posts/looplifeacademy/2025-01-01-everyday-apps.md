When you’re living the cruising life, staying organized and connected takes more than just a few good habits—it takes great apps.

Over the years, we’ve discovered a handful of everyday apps that help us manage everything from grocery lists to social connections. Whether we’re planning a passage, staying in touch with loved ones, or tracking our progress, these apps have become essential tools for our life afloat.

### [AnyList](https://www.anylist.com/): Never Forget a Provision

One app we rely on constantly is **AnyList**. My husband and I share a grocery list through this app, making it easy to track what provisions we need the next time we hit a store. Whether it’s stocking up on fresh produce or restocking snacks for the kids, AnyList ensures nothing gets forgotten. We also use it for to-do lists—especially before big passages. It’s a simple, effective way to stay on top of things.

### [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/): Your Personal Recipe Organizer

Cooking on board is one of my favorite parts of cruising, and **Paprika** keeps it all organized. I’ve stored all my favorite recipes here, and it’s so easy to download new ones from the internet or type in recipes from cookbooks. The app also lets me add my own notes, tweak recipes to fit what we have on hand, and even plan meals for the week. It’s a lifesaver when you’re provisioning and meal-planning in remote places.

### [Messenger Kids](https://www.messengerkids.com/): Staying Connected for the Kids

Our kids love using **Messenger Kids** to stay in touch with their cousins, friends, and other boat kids we’ve met along the way. It’s kid-friendly, with parental controls, and it gives them a sense of independence while staying connected with loved ones. For our family, it’s been a great way to keep friendships alive as we move from place to place.

### [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/): Cruising Communication Made Easy

WhatsApp is a must-have if you’re cruising on the East Coast or hopping between countries. It’s incredibly popular among cruisers, making creating group chats for specific locations or coordinating with friends during passages easy. We’ve used it to stay in touch with other boats, share weather updates, and even organize meet-ups at marinas. We also use it for video calls with family back home.

### Social Media: Sharing the Journey

Apps like **Instagram** and **Facebook** are our go-tos for sharing pictures and stories from our journey. They’re perfect for keeping friends and family updated on our adventures and staying in touch with loved ones. Plus, it’s fun to scroll through and see what our fellow cruisers are up to!

### [Aura](https://auraframes.com/#how-it-works): Sharing the Adventure in Real-Time

We love using **Aura** digital frames to keep our parents connected to our journey. With the app, we upload photos of our adventures directly to their frames, so they can see where we’ve been and what we’ve been up to. It’s an easy and meaningful way to share our experiences, even when we’re miles apart.

### [Blue Boat Log](https://blueboatlog.com/): Tracking for Fun

We love **Blue Boat Log** for tracking our trips and competing with friends. This app lets us keep a record of our journeys and compare distances traveled with other users. It’s kind of like a friendly competition and a digital scrapbook rolled into one. We treat it as a fun way to look back on our progress and celebrate milestones.

### [Nebo](https://www.nebo.global/): Connecting with Fellow Loopers

Among Loopers, **Nebo** is a fan favorite. We use it to spot other Loopers on the map. Boats with Nebo often display digital burgees, making it easy to connect with fellow cruisers nearby. It’s a great tool for building community on the water.

### [NoForeignLand](https://www.noforeignland.com/): Connecting with Cruising Families

**NoForeignLand** is an invaluable app for connecting with the cruising community, especially for finding other family boats. By joining groups like **Kids4Sail**, we can easily spot nearby cruising families and reach out to plan meetups. Beyond that, the app is great for discovering fun activities, points of interest, and helpful local information wherever we’re anchored. It’s a fantastic resource for building connections and making the most of every destination.
